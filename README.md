Hi there! My name is Cassidy Clayton. i'm just winging this for an assignment ans trying to figure out how this works, so this isn't going to be a very good bio. 21, Christian, ENFP, fangirl, likes cold burn alcohol over warm burn alcohol, would rather be inhabiting fictional worlds 9 days our of 10, etc. But here we are, working to learn something useful XD
