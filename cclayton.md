We're weird, as a species. Most creatures avoid things that are potentially toxic to them--they've learned, and they know better.  
But not us. Oh no, not humans. Nature tries its hardest to make us doubt, or at the very least question our choice of edible items, but we
continue onwards out of sheer spite. Even commonly known plants have chemical compounds that could be toxic. Some are more toxic in their wild forms,
some have to e cooked a certain way to be conscumable, and some only affect certain parts of the population, but all three of these fairly 
common edible plants contain poison.

# Potato  
_Solanum tuberosum_

Ah, potatoes. The staple of Irish (and souther) food. Where would we be without them?  
But also, who was the crazy sod who first thought "hmm, maybe i can eat this? 

## Glycoalkoids

Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as glycoalkaloids, of which the most prevalent are solanine and chaconine.
Solanine is also found in other members of the Solanaceae plant family, which includes Atropa belladonna ("deadly nightshade") 
and Hyoscyamus niger ("henbane") (see entries below). The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes is sufficient to produce 
toxic effects in humans. The toxin affects the nervous system, causing headaches, diarrhea and intense digestive disturbances, cramps, 
weakness and confusion, and in severe cases coma and death. Poisoning from cultivated potatoes occurs very rarely, however, as toxic 
compounds in the potato plant are generally concentrated in the green portions of the plant and in the fruits, and cultivated varieties
contain smaller concentrations than wild plants.[18][19] Cooking at high temperatures (over 170 °C or 340 °F) also partly destroys the 
toxin. However, exposure to light, physical damage, and age can increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber,[20] the highest 
concentrations occurring just underneath the skin. Tubers that are exposed to light turn green from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving 
a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening
and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Some varieties of potato contain greater glycoalkaloid 
concentrations than others; breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising 
cultivar. Breeders try to keep solanine levels below 200 mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, 
even they can approach concentrations of solanine of 1000 mg/kg (1000 ppmw). The U.S. National Toxicology Program suggests that the 
average American consume no more than 12.5 mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is actually several times this, depending 
on body weight).

# Rhubarb  
_Rheum rhaponticum_

Common in northeastern pies, jams, and jellies, rhubarb is a staple for most of us who live in upstate NY. But this plant has a toxin
that we haven't been able to pin down yet! 

## Oxalic acid (and maybe something else, too. Who knows? Not us)

The leaf stalks (petioles) are edible, but the leaves themselves contain notable quantities of oxalic acid, which is a nephrotoxic 
and corrosive acid present in many plants. Symptoms of poisoning include kidney disorders, convulsions and coma, though it is rarely 
fatal. The LD50 (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375 mg/kg body weight,[21] or about 25 grams for a 65 kg 
(~140 lb) human. Although the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%,[22] so almost 5 kg of 
the extremely sour leaves would have to be consumed to reach the LD50. Cooking the leaves with soda can make them more poisonous by 
producing soluble oxalates.[23] However, the leaves are believed to also contain an additional, unidentified toxin,[24] which might 
be an anthraquinone glycoside (also known as senna glycosides).[25] In the edible leaf stalks, the concentration of oxalic acid is
much lower, contributing only about 2–2.5% of the total acidity, which is dominated by malic acid.[26] This means that even the raw 
stalks may not be hazardous (though they are generally thought to be in the US). However, the tart taste of the raw stalks is so 
strong as to be unpalatable to most consumers.

# Mango
_Mangifera indica_  

Know anyone sensitive to poison ivy? Like, _really_ sensitive? 
Maybe, as a firend, remind them to wear gloves next time they handle mango peel. 

## Urushiol
Mango peel and sap contain urushiol, the allergen in poison ivy and poison sumac that can cause 
urushiol-induced contact dermatitis in susceptible people. Cross-reactions between mango contact 
allergens and urushiol have been observed. Those with a history of poison ivy or poison oak contact 
dermatitis may be most at risk for such an allergic reaction. Urushiol is also present in mango leaves 
and stems. During mango's primary ripening season, it is the most common source of plant dermatitis in Hawaii.
